        The following example changes the fanout value to 128:

        The following example enables debug messages:

          - "debug": Boolean value indicating whether to enable library

          - "print_debug": Debug messages processing function. This
            function takes 2 arguments: the task instance and the
            message string (default: an internal function doing standard
            print).
          - "fanout": Max number of registered clients in Engine at a
            time (default: 64).

            remote host before aborting (default: 10).

            unlimited).

        Threading considerations
        ========================
          Unlike set_default(), the underlying info dictionary is only
          modified from the task's thread. So calling set_info() from
          another thread leads to queueing the request for late apply
          (at run time) using the task dispatch port. When received,
          the request wakes up the engine when the task is running and
          the info dictionary is then updated.

        Schedule a shell command for local or distant parallel

        a local or remote Worker (depending on the presence of the
        nodes parameter) and immediately schedule it for execution in
        task runloop. So, if the task is already running (ie. called
        from an event handler), the command is started immediately,
        assuming the fanout constraint is met. If the task is not
        running, the command is not started but scheduled for late

            automatically aborted as soon as all other non-autoclosing
            task objects (workers, ports, timers) have finished --
            default is False

        ev_msg event notification issued the port's task. If handler

        once or repeatedly at fixed time intervals. Repeating timers
        can also have their next firing time manually adjusted.

        The mandatory parameter `fire' sets the firing delay in seconds.

        the timer. If not specified, the timer fires once and then is
