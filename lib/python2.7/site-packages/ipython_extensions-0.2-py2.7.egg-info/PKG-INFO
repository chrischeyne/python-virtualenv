Description: IPython extensions of varying usability and maturity
        
        You may install this package to add interesting and/or useful features to 
        enhance your IPython experience. Contributions to this package are encouraged,
        with the 'release early, release often' maxim - it is expected that the original
        contributor (as opposed to the core IPython team) will take care of most of the 
        maintenance of his/her own extension.
